# LedgerLite
A minimal event-driven personal transaction ledger API.

## Restricting myself
When working with this project, I will intentionally restrict myself to the following:
* I will not rely on Copilot or any AI code generation tools to write code for me. I will write all code myself to ensure I understand every line and can learn effectively. (I may use AI tools for guidance, but not for code generation.)
* I will focus on Go as the primary programming language, and I will not switch to other languages for this project. (When the project is complete, I may explore other languages for similar projects, but for now, I will stick to Go.)
* I will focus on backend development and will not implement any frontend or UI components for this project.
* I will limit my work sessions to 1 hour each, to maintain focus and avoid burnout. (I may take breaks between sessions, but I will not exceed 1 hour of coding in a single session.)

## Project Scope
The project will be a minimal event-driven personal transaction ledger API, with the following features:
* Create account
* Record transaction
* Query balance
* List transactions
* Publish transaction events

The project will not include any complex domain logic, and I will avoid adding features that are not essential to the core functionality of the ledger API.

## Learning Goals
Through this project, I aim to practice and improve my skills in the following areas:
* API design
* Database modeling
* Concurrency
* Event publishing
* Idempotency
* Observability
* Graceful shutdown
* Production thinking
I will focus on writing clean, maintainable code and will strive to create a well-designed API that is easy to use and understand.
